# Home Energy Data API - Data Source Documentation
Documentation of data, formulae, and scientific conversions supporting Zwell's home energy audit and calculation tools.

* [Energy conversions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gqgwpOMkCsCWgHzdk7omc0xRaLz4ZHW64pKcWLB7BS4/edit?usp=sharing)
* Appliance table
* Fuel/utility cost table
* State electricity production data
* Zip code data (weather stations, water sites)
* Solar insolation logic
* Heating & cooling logic
* Water heating logic
* Lighting energy logic
* Energy generation logic
* CO2 emissions logic
* Operating cost logic

Dynamic Data:
* Heating Degree Days & Cooling Degree Days (at a weather station level)
  * We pull the historical temperature data by weather station from the [GHCNd](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)
  * We use an assumption around a 65Â° internal home temperature to determine heat degree and cooling degree days. We arrived at this number based on [EIA's definition](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/degree-days.php).
* Ground Water Temperature (or Surface Water Temperature) (at a water site level
  * [USGS Water Service API](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/dataretrieval/)
* Electricity Production Sources (at a state level)
* Natural Gas Utility Price (at a state level)
* Electricity Utility Price (at a state level)
* Other Fuel Prices (Propane, Fuel Oil, Kerosene, Wood, Wood Pellets) (at a national average level)
  * [EIA Open Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)
    * Natural Gas - Monthly by State
    * Electricity - Monthly by State
    * Propane - Weekly by State
    * Heating Oil - Weekly by State
  * We'd like to use APIv2 to connect pull this data by state as frequently as it is updated.

Static Data:
* Heating, Cooling, Water Heating
  * Every appliance category has its own measure e.g. SEER and this is sourced from [AHRI](https://www.ahridirectory.org/) using a median rating for each product type and fuel type.
* Appliance annual energy usage
  * We are tyring to source the median efficiency from the [FTC's EnergyGuide](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/tools-consumers/energyguide-labels) for the following:
    * Boilers
    * Ceiling Fans
    * Central Air Conditioners
    * Clothes Washers
    * Dishwashers
    * Freezers
    * Furnaces
    * Heat Pumps
    * Pool Heaters
    * Refrigerators
    * Televisions
    * Water Heaters
    * Room and Portable Air Aonditioners
    * Light Bulbs
  * We don't have create documentation on the efficiency sources for the following appliances and need help sourcing:
    * Cooktops
    * Ovens
    * Dryers  
* Zip code latitude and longitude
  * [Geo Names](https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/ )
* Home R values
  * International Energy Conservation Code
* ACH values
  * ASHRAE?
  * https://basc.pnnl.gov/information/infiltration-meets-ach50-requirements
  * We'd like a better source for this, for now we've used data from a home energy inspector.
* Water usage averages
